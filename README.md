## Open Application
It's a simple [page](https://antomatskev.github.io/bhavacakra/) meant to help you evaluate your current priorities in life.
The default Wheel has 16 categories, but you can add your own there or remove all and start adding completely different categories.

This is a fork of the great [page](https://github.com/codescale/Wheel-Of-Life) by [@codescale](https://github.com/codescale).
